        <p>A US think tank, non political, dedicated to the promotion of individual liberty, free markets, and limited government. As these organization go, CATO is influential to US policy more than any other freedom loving group. you can join for $100 a year and get their news magazines, their monthly audio CD, and so much other information their scholars put out. I know the president and many scholars personally. Great organization!</p>

          <h2>Hillsdale College - Imprimis</h2>
          <p>We all know that college campuses in America are overwhelmingly liberal. Hillsdale is different. They are sticking to the principles in our Constitution. They publish an incredibly popular monthly publication containing one meaningful, thought provoking article by a thought leader. It’s called Imprimis. You can sign up free at Imprimis.hillsdale.edu.</p>

          <h2>Project Veritas</h2>
          <p>James O’Keefe and his team are undercover investigative journalists. He’s the one who exposed Acorn, Obamacare Navigators, NPR, and corrupt politicians from both sides of the aisle. Bravely doing what the media establishment won’t, the Project Veritas team risk their own reputations and legal trouble exposing corruption right here in the US. It’s hard, long, risky work and James deserves our support. Read James book!</p>

          <h2>Moving Picture Website</h2>
          <p>We all know media and movies are very powerful ways to communicate and tell a story. The Moving Picture Institute identifies and supports promising filmmakers who want to promote liberty and fight corruption. They have produced movies that expose for example – the New Jersey Teachers Union, the United Nations, and our ever growing free spending government. They make fact based movies that Hollywood won’t. I have some you can borrow or just the titles from their website and watch them “On Demand.”</p>
